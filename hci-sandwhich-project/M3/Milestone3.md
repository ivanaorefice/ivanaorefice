# Milestone 3: Wireframe and Skeleton - SandWHICH?

## Wireframe
We used Balsamiq tool to make the 2 wireframe. Starting from M2, we took some important decisions about the pages organization, the main problem was the amount of information which we have to rappresent in some cases, like in the manager side.

Wireframe #1:

We chose to rappresent the Homepage with the main layout details. The Homepage is simply and clearly, it shows our logo and slogan on the top, in the body part you can see the daily men√π, discounts and a recap about last orders. Clicking on the top roght icon you will get your personal profile page.
Throught the menu, in the top left corner, the user can start a new order, check notifications, and manage setting's account.

Wireframe #2:

We chose to rappresent the principal manager page, which has to rappresent many information. Here the manager can see, manage and interact with the customer orders. 
The main information which the manager needs are: the order ID generated basing on timestamp and priority, stuffing details (bread type, principal, secondary  and sauce) and  order status.
At the screen center you can see the orders list which is organized in two different tables, one for the new orders, the other for ready orders whcih are waiting to be deliver. In the tables the main information are reported and, for every order, a button is present. When a current order is ready, the "Ready" button is pressed in order to shift it in the Ready order list. A notification is send to the costumer in order to notify the sandwich is ready.
When a Ready order is delivered, the "Delivered" button is pressed to finish the preparation routine and delete it from the second tabel.
  
In the right side you can check the current orders amount and set the orders limit that the shop can accept at the moment. 
Pressing the microfon icon in the right down corner, the voice recognition is actived, and you can use vocal commands in order to manager orders.

## UI Skeleton
For the skeleton we used a temporany graphical interface, we have created all the navigable pages and realize all the links.
The user experience is not so cool, in the final project we will take care more about it.
We assume the user is already loggeded in as customer and manager too, indeed the customer user will can not navigate in the manager side. 
In the manager page you can see the orders list as described before, you can see order details and manage it.
In the customer side the user can create his own sandwich throught 3 steps: type bread, main ingredient, secondary stuffing. In the last step the customer can review the order  and choose the payment method.
