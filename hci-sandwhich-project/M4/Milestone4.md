## Results and List of Changes
The evaluation of our prototype as been conducted at 18th January in a studyroom of EDISU Borsellino University Residence. Tree different people took part to the test:
- Alessia, a 24 years old Italian student
- Mohammad a 25 years old, Pakistan student
- Aamir, 25 years old, from Pakistan too

This three guys have been selected because they are a good representative sample of our target population. 
One of us rules the facilitator part, another one took notes and the third made some videos and photos, in order to collect all the data needed to perform an analysis.

Our Sanwhich system prototype has been tested by them following the one-by-one methodology, using as guideline the script that our team prepared before. We asked to tester to follow the "Think aloud" approch, to collect several comments, good points and issues that came out during the test.


The testers' behaviors held during the test had some key points in common:
- The tester have always recognized the application's purpose at the first look, and, at the first sight, they compared it with other similar compatitor like JustEat of UberEat.
- The first actions, performed during the "free exploration" part, were look quickly the home page (in particular images and layout in general) and click on "Make an Order" tab, on the top right. After this 2 actions they has explored some other site parts in different order but we assume that the main action that a user can perform on our application (Create and order a sandwich) is enought highlighted. 

During the task number 1, we noticed that 2 user out of 3 didn't understand immediatly that had to click on a ingredient to select it in order to create their own sandwich. A better design and a short explanation is needed in that page. Furthermore, the summary of selected ingredients, in the right side, was not noticed immediatly. A better integration on this two parts is required, in order to have a complete page's vision.  

In payment page the testers have commented two aspects: 
- The pop-up error window that opens if a information has been not provide by user, was a too much strong feedback.
- A confirmation step about payment is required, or alternatively, a better design of the information page will help to understand what you are confirmed with the "Confirm" button.
Finally we notice that the "Contact" field should be pre-filled we the right user contact.

During the task number 2 a tester had some problems with the voice assistent comunication, probably because of slow internet connection that worsens performance, low microphone quality and some pronunciation issues. With a better equipment and the correct pronunciation, the system works better.
It is not immediately clear how to active the voice assistent, the standalone microphone icon is not enought to understand what is it for. Some comments were about complexity of manager pages and the differences between the two tables, but after a short explanation the tester understood how is it organized and how perform the task.

In the task number 3, that has been performed in the same conditions and pages of task 2, the goal has been completed quickly without particular obstacles, except for one case, where the tester clicked on the wrong "Ready" button. Some pronunciation problem come out using the voice assistent. 

Tester number 2, he is commenting the site layout:

After the end of the test, each tester compiles the System Usability Scale, also known as SUS Questionnaire:

[SUS Questionnaire Tester 1](/M4/Photo/sus_1.png)
Given the answers reported, the total score for the tester 1 SUS is : 90

[SUS Questionnaire Tester 2](/M4/Photo/sus_2.png)
The total score for the tester 2 SUS is : 92.5

[SUS Questionnaire Tester 3](/M4/Photo/sus_3.png)
The total score for the tester 3 SUS is : 92.5

A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, the maximum score is 100, so the results reached are good.


Debrifing: after the test, the team had a short meeting to discuss about the evaluations, considering also the results obtained by the SUS questionnaires. We located some good points of our prototype like graphical layout, the design of creating sandwich part, and the good user experince. As described above, some changes are needes to fix few bigger problem and improve minor bugs and details. 

We agreeded on some main changes to be made:
- Make order page: 
Disable the "Check out" button if the user didn't select at least a bread type and a principal ingredient. Prevent this error is better than get an error feedback, the tester said that was unplesant.
Make clear that the user have to click on ingredients to select them, improve che graphical aspect and highlight the summary table on the right side. At first, the users tried to create their sandwich just sliding the carousel without click on ingredients.

- Payment page: 
Provide a default contact number to avoid to ask it at the user everytime, but there should be the possibility to change this default contact. Some of the testers was not happy to insert their phone number for every order. 
Provide a recap about the saved payment information, and let the user to change/update it. A tester notice that he didn't feel safe to select the order payment and don't receive the information about the credit card saved on the site. 

- Manager page:
Highlight the voice assistant part, help the user to understand how does it work. For the users, it was not immediatly clear how activate and use it.
Improve the differences between the two tables, more white space and bigger titles may help as suggested by one of the testers.  
Try to use a better microphone and internet connection. Vocal communication issues has been located. 
Develop a system that help the user to recover a wrong action (es. Ready button clicked for mistake), how did it happen during task number 3 for a tester.
