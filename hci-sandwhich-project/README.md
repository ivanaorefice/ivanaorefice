# SandWHICH?

The project aimed to create a Web Application, named SandWHICH?, which helps the user to reduce its time in queue while waiting for a sandwhich.
The interesting part of the project was the finding of the "problem to solve" which was carried out following the guidelines of a good Human Computer Interaction: being user
friendly, being very intuitive to use, being easy to reach and finally (and most importantly) being able to solve a real problem.
