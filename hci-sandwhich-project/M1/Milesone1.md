# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: SandWHICH?

## Overview and planning

The subject of our activity is the Sandwich Shop “30ELode”

About types of people considered in our case study, we considered employees (field of interest: kitchen), the owner of the shop (field of interest: booking a sandwich) and clients (fields of interest: consuming a sandwich).

Currently, the owner is also in charge of managing payments and has the goal of taking orders and pass them to the kitchen, that will execute them.
In particular, once the owner has received the order, she performs the payment (using cash, POS or Satispay), and, when the sandwich is ready, she calls the client who has made that order using a ticket with a number released to the client during the payment phase, and delivers his/her order.

When customers arrive, after waiting for their number to be called, they choose the type of bread, the ingredients and other characteristics of the sandwich and the owner takes note of their order through a pre-filled spreadsheet and passes it to the kitchen. When the order is ready, one of the 5 kitchen employee rings a bell and sticks out the sandwich, and the owner hands it to the customer attaching the number.
In the current situation, there are no virtual interfaces but only paper ones (a spreadsheet to fill out with a pen and the ticket number), and the result is that long queues are created outside the shop, especially at lunch time, slowing down sandwich delivery.

## Observation

Interviewed #1: Alessandra 

Occupation: worker 

Observations:
Alessandra is a young worker, she is 26 years old and she use to have lunch away from home during the week. For this reason she is part of our user’s target. 
We observed Alessandra during a normal lunch in a cloudy Friday. Her lunch break started at 1.00 pm, with some colleagues decided to go in a sandwich shop near their work place. At 13.15 pm she arrived to the shop and there was a long queue outside the local, we count more or less 15 people. Luckily it was not a rainy day anyway the waiting has been long, in fact for every person the wating time for the order was at least 2 min. 
During that time Alessadra deiced the sandwich stuffing after read all the options from a long list inside the shop. At 01.45pm was her turn and an employ ask to Alessandra her decision, he wrote all the ingredients on a paper and he passed it to the kitchen throungh a window beind him, finally he give the order's id to Alessandra. 
After that our interviewed waited more or less 10 min before the order was ready. The employ called Alessandra’s ID and after waiting 40 min in total she obtained her lunch. There was not free place to seat down in the shop, so she decided to eat her sandwich outside the local. 
Her first comment was about the long waiting time but she was happy however because the sandwich size was big and because she has pay just 3.5 euro. At 2.15 pm after finished the lunch and after a chat with us, she returned to the office with the colleagues to restart the work at 2.30 pm. 


Interviewed #2: Shahrukh Iqbal 

Occupation: Student 

Observations: 
Shahrukh is 24 years old international student, he come from Pakistan and he’s attend the computer engineering master at Politecnico of Turin. We deced to interview Shahrukh because he’s perfect for our target. We observed him during a typically lunch during a normal day. 
At 11.4 am he had a lesson’s break and he thought to take a sandwich to eat later, during the lunch time. In this way he want to avoid the typical queue at the shop during the peak time. At 11.45 am he arrived tho the sandwich's shop and there was not long queue like he has he forcasted, but there was already 5-7 people inside. 
After few min he told to a employ his order, and the kitchen received it immediately via a paper that the employ had pass them. After 5 min Shahrukh has been informed the lunch was ready and at 12.00 am he returned at Politecnico for next lesson. 


Interviewed #3: Barbara De Santis 

Occupation: 30 e Lode worker

Observations: 
Barbara allowed us to observe her work at the sandwich shop and for us it has been a gold occasion to study the sandwich shop’s work from a different point of view. We observed Barbara during the peak time in a typically work day, at 01.00 pm.
Outside the shop there was a long queue of students and young worker. Barbara’s task was about taken orders, pass them to the kitchen, manage the customer payment, and deliver the ready sandwiches to them. When a customer arrive, she asks about the sandwich’s stuffing, she takes note on a pre compiled paper made schema and pass it to a kitchen employ through a window behind she.
After that she ask to the costumer how he want to pay choosing from cash, credit card and Satispay. After the payment Barbara gives a Id number to the costumer and re start the task with next person. 
When a sandwich is ready, the kitchen’s employ ring a bell, Barbara find the ready lunch behind her and call the relative ID number. The right costumer come to take the sandwich and she give it the him. 
The waiting time from a order to the ready sandwich is about 10-15 min, but the waiting time in the queue can be very long, something like 30-40 min. 
In the afternoon we return to Barbara for the interview.

## Interviews


Interviewer: Hamza Rashid (H)

Interviewee: Shahrukh Iqbal (S)

Topic: Sandwich shop review

Date: 21/10/19

H: Hi I am Hamza and today I have Shahrukh with me. Hi Shahrukh, how are you?

S: I am fine thanks, how are you?

H: I am also fine thanks. First, thank you for joining me today. I will try my best to make it as quick as
possible to save your precious time. So Shahrukh we are working on a project and for that we need
your help. Your opinions and reviews would be appreciated.

S: Hamza can I ask what this project is about?

H: Sure. We are working on an ordering system of a restaurant so we need your review because you
have told me that you have already been there before (30 E LODE).

S: Yes.

H: So, first, I am going to ask some questions about you and your daily routine. Is it ok for you?

S: Yes, no problem.

H: Thank you. So first tell me about yourself. What do you do here?

S: I am doing master’s in computer engineering. Its my first year. I am from Pakistan. I am an
international student.

H: Ahan, how is it going?

S: it’s going well.

H: What’s the best thing you like here?

S: There are lot of thing I like here but the best among them is the behaviour of Italians here. They
are so helpful, and they are so polite. Whenever I ask anybody for help, they always responded
nicely.

H: Yeah 100% true. What about food? I mean which type of food you like here.

S: Usually at home I like to cook my native food which I used to eat in Pakistan. It’s not because of
that I don’t like Italian food. The thing is that we are keen of eating spicy food and Italian foods are
not that much spicy.

H: Yeah, they are pretty much simple. Is there any Pakistani restaurant nearby Politecnico?

S: No. But its near Lingotto where I live.

H: Oh, you live too far.

S: Yes.

H: So, what do you eat when you are here in Politecnico.

S: Most of the time I eat from Mensa and 30 E LODE (the sandwich shop).

H: How often you go to that sandwich shop?

S: 2 to 3 times a week.

H: And what about the other days.

S: Sometimes I go to Mensa but on Friday I don’t go to any of those places. Because I don’t have
time to eat so I take something from the vending machine.

H: Why is that? You can just go to get the food and eat it on your way to the class. Why vending
machine?

S: Yes, but I usually eat lunch between 1 to 2 pm and that’s when it gets crowdy. You must wait to
place your order then you must wait for your food. It takes time and I don’t usually have that much
time. I have class.

H: You have mentioned that your lunchtime is between 1 to 2.

S: Yes.

H: Is there anything special about this time?

S: There is nothing special about this time. It’s just that I am usually free this time on other days of
the week.

H: Oh, I see. So, what is the good thing to like about that restaurant?

S: They have pretty good sandwiches and salads as well. I can choose my own sandwiches and I can
modify it according to my own taste. Apart from that my friends also go to this restaurant, so I get
some good compony.

H: Very good. Is there anything you don’t like about this restaurant?

S: Sometimes it gets too crowdy. We don’t find any space to sit and it takes too much time to place
your order because of the long queues.

H: Oh, that’s bad I can relate. So, do you think there should be any solution for this?

S: Yes, for sure.

H: Do you have something in mind?

S: There should be something like a delivery service?

H: You want a delivery service like UberEATS or Glovo?

S: Yes Obviously.

H: So, you want a delivery service that can deliver your food in your class or lunchroom?

S: No, it’s not something I want. It’s something I need.

H: Why you don’t want it?

S: Because sometimes you get tired by sitting in your class and you want to walk and to have fun
with your friends.

H: Hmm, that’s interesting. So, what if there is a mobile app or a web app that can take your order.
When its ready it will let you know so you can just go and grab your food. Or you can sit there and
enjoy with your friends. It will save time.

S: It sounds interesting?

H: Yes, it is. Btw which device you think you will be using in case this service become available?

S: In Politecnico I usually have my phone and my laptop with me. I think these will be feasible for me
to order my food.

H: Ok very well. Thank you so much Sharukh for your time and giving me your worthy review. It will
help me and my project members for our project.

Interviewer: M (Ivana Orefice)  

Alessandra: A (Worker)



M: First of all, I wanted to ask you if you are a student or a worker and, in particular, how you usually
have lunch when you are in your workplace or study.

A: I am doing an intership at Politecnico. Normally at lunch I try to prepare something myself when
I can, but often, given the tight schedule, I buy something, for example sandwiches or salads. When
I prepare something, I prepare pasta, or even the sandwich I look for at home.

M: Mainly sandwich ... However, if it should happen to eat the sandwich or even outside ...

A:  Sometimes I try to prepare lunch at home, mostly pasta. But based on the time and the
desire to cook, I take the food out, preferring the sandwich, sometimes a salad, I have rarely eaten
ready meals, like pasta...

M: So isn't the sandwich your first choice?

A: No, indeed I prefer something else, like wraps.

M: Second question. Regarding today's lunch, what did you like and what did you hate.

A: The sandwich is very good, big, and therefore satisfied so much that sometimes I don't finish it,
the price is low, and this is good for students and trainees. I didn't like the queue that always forms in
the peak time, the place is small and therefore often the queue goes out. Wehen there is bad weather, moreover, 
it often remains to queue outside in the cold, and it's not the best.
Moreover, not only does he expect a first time to make the receipt but he also expects for the sandwich itself, so there is a quite
awkward double wait for those with short times.
Agreement on the quality / price ratio, excellent quality and quantity of the product. The location
of the restaurant is perfect, very close to the work place and easy to reach. 
I love that there are options different from the sandwich (like wraps, salads, etc.), and I like that
they can create different "fantasy" combinations. 


M: I ask you if you think there are solutions to the problems you have exposed and which could be.

A: If the place was larger, it would be nice to avoid the queue outside and be able to sit at the table
inside. One way to eliminate the wait could be or hire more people, but this depends on them, or
provide a chance to book the sandwich, for example via a social network or a dedicated app, and it could
also be a way to better manage peak times.
The room should be wider, to be able to sit and have lunch more quietly. To get rid of the queue
I get into the idea of the app: it could be the room itself that decides a time to give to those who
have booked, so as to avoid people who are waiting.


M: If there were a mobile app, you would use it.

A: Yes, it would simplify the times.

M: Which device do you use the most?

A: Smartphone, it's easier to use, it's always in our hands.

Interviewer: Roberto S.  
Interviewee: Barbara De Santis (Manager of 30L)  

Roberto: "Tell me about yourself and your job in 30 e Lode"

Barbara: "I am Barbara De Santis, I am in charge of the cash register, I take orders and i pass them to the
kitchen"

R: "How did you organize your work?"

B: "Customers arrive here, choose the ingredients, I take note of their order and i pass them to the kitchen.
When the order is ready, the cook rings a bell and sticks out the sandwich ready, I take it and I make the
transition to the customer. "

R: “So customers do a queue and order directly from you, you report the ingredients on a pre-compiled
diagram and you pass this sheet to the kitchen. It's correct? "

B: "Yes, that's right”

R: "Do you think there are downsides in this applied methodology that, perhaps, make the process difficult
or slow down it?"

B: "Actually we have found a method that I think does not present any slowing down problems. Initially I
took orders directly on a white paper notebook, now we have introduced this card where I just have to put
X's and I'm even faster. "

R: "So having schematized the work has speeded up your job sufficiently?"

B: "Exactly, also because if I went even faster the kitchen workers would not be able to keep up. The
kitchen is small and there are 5 workers that take care of the preparation of the sandwich, so even if I could
speed up my work even more, for example with 2 people to collect orders, the entire process can’t be
speed up. "

R: "I think I understood that the critical point is the preparation of the sandwich "

B: "Exactly, we could not go faster than that. We can't prepare anything in advance, so we have to do
everything at the time. Each customer chooses from a long list how many ingredients he wants without
forecasting. In the 3 years of activity we have tried many solutions to speed up the preparation process and
5 people in the kitchen are the best we could do. "

R: "In your opinion, if there was a way to anticipate the collection of orders, what advantages would it bring
to the process?"

B: "In reality we already accept orders in advance by a call or messages, but if we collect too many orders
by phone we slow down the service to customers who physically come here, so we accept only to a certain
number of orders."

R: "So, as a matter of priority, the client who come here to the local is more important"

B: "Yes, also because it happens that many guys are to queue even in the rain and I don't want make them
wait even longer. So as long as 4-5 orders I accept them by phone but no more. They also proposed me to
enter in the Just Eat circuit but I refused just for this reason, image that I receive 100 orders, I prepare them
but I have to ignore customers who have been coming to us for 3 years and are queuing up. "

R: "Therefore, becouse that you can't organize anything in advance, a reservation system would be difficult,
did I understand correctly?"

B: "Yes, our ingredients are all fresh and the only preparation that we can do in advance is slice the cold meats, for the
rest there are things that must be done at the moment like cooking meat"

R: "What is the peak time usually?"

B: "At 1.00 pm more or less"

R: "What is the payment method most used by customers?"

B: "In order are: cash, POS and Satispay. All three are widely used even if the use of Satispay is always
wider, as is the Bancomat ”

R: "One last question: Do you think the use of a tablet for your work and for kitchen workers could be a
limitation?"

B: "In my opinion yes, I am very used to working with this scheme filled in with a pen and even a
modification of an order is very immediate. Through an application I think it is too cumbersome and would
slow me down "

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Needs


1. Possibility to book and have a delivery service directly on the destination place (classroom, or at least inside the Politecnico);
2. Possibility to book and pay in advance, and go to the shop only to retire the sandwich avoiding the queue;
3. Possibility to have a larger restaurant, to consume the sandwich inside it and  a larger kitchen and hire more people;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description
