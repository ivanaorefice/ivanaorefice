# Twice but Nice - Second Hand Market Application

The project has been developed in Team during the 2nd semester of 2019/20 Academic Year in Politecnico di Torino.
The goal of our application was to create a second-hand market application. The user, which could sign up and Login to interact properly with the application, had the opportunity to:

1. Manage its personal page, where it was possible to see/change its personal information, like name, username and password, and also its location, opportunally displayed with Google 
Maps
2. See the list of objects that are currently on sale in the market. By clicking the single object, the user could see a detailed list of information about that object, including 
an image/photo, the name of the user who is selling that object, the category of the object, the location and so on.
3. Add a new object to sell: the user can add a new object to sell, with all of the information required to give a good explanation of the objec itself

The work was carried ot with Android Studio, which allowed to develop directly the layout of the application (see main/res folder) with .xml files, and, in parallel, carrying out
the implementation of the behaviour of the application, written in Kotlin (see java folder). Finally, we preferred to develop the application in FRAGMENTS, instead of using 
different activities.

The project has been developed taking advantage of some of Google tools, like Maps (used to display the location in various fragments) and Firebase (used to manage the server-side of the application).
